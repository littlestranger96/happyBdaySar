                    <h2>Hey Birthday Girl</h2>
                    <p>Some people walk into your life and sprinkle a little joy. Others? They float in on fairy wings, carrying an entire cloud of love, warmth, and chaotic good energy. That‚Äôs you Sar.</p>
                    <p>From the moment I met you, I knew you weren‚Äôt just any person..you were magic. The kind of magic that makes people feel safe, seen, and loved. The kind that makes a place feel like home, even when it‚Äôs just a little server on the internet.</p>
                    <p>So today, on your special day, this is all about you. A small, digital love letter to show you just how much you‚Äôre adored. Because honestly? You deserve everything. And maybe even a pet dragon, but I‚Äôm still working on that. Happy Birthday, Queen!</p>

                    <p>You, on the other hand? Effortlessly cool. Even if it‚Äôs just a hobby, you make it look so natural. Keep strumming, keep vibing, and keep casually being better at things than the rest of us.</p>
